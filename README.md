# Neural-ODE

This is my implementation of NeurIPS paper of the year 2018, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations in PyTorch.
Whoever has access to a robust GPU can train it on publicly available datasets like MNIST,CIFAR,ImageNet. It is similar to a resnet in architecture but works differently and consumes less memory. Help would be appreciated as this could be extended to other projects.
